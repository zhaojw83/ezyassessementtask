1. about the source.html from fiddek/ezy assessement task 6.
   I copy the code from the url into the file named old-source.html.But it can not work correctly.So i update it,and renamed it source.html.I think it can work now.
2. about the file directory named new.
   In this directroy,I recode it by AngularJs2.And the source code is by typescript.In this directory,i set up the Angular from the url https://angular.cn/docs/ts/latest/guide/setup.html.And the center code is new/src/app.So you can just read the files.
